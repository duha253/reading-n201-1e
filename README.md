## HTML5 Layout

**HTML5 Layout
HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the  structure of a page.


### Traditional HTML Layouts;
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
  
  ### New Html5 Layout Elements;
The point of creating these new elements is so that web page authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page. For example, screen reader software might allow users to ignore headers and footers and get straight to the content. Similarly, search engines might place more weight on the content in an <article> element than that in the <header> or <footer> elements. 
  
  
  -**Headers & Footers
The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
  
● The main header or footer that appears at the top orbottom of every page on the site.

● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the pag
  
  
-**Navigation ;<nav>
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

-**Articles;<article>
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

-**Asides<aside>
The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

-**Sections <section>
The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

-**Heading Groups ;<hgroup>
The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading

-**Figures;<figure> <figcaption>
 It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). 



  ## Summary
  
**HTML5 LAYOUT**

⦁	 The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

⦁	 The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
  
⦁	 Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

⦁	 To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google
